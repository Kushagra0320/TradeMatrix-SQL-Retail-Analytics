# TradeMatrix-SQL-Retail-Analytics
TradeMatrix: SQL Retail Analytics is a structured SQL-based analytics project  that enables retail businesses to make data-driven decisions by understanding what drives revenue, which products succeed, and how customers behave over time—all using pure SQL logic.
It uses well-defined queries and aggregations to produce two key reports:

Product Report – Analyzes essential product metrics such as total sales, order volume, quantity sold, customer reach, and lifespan. It classifies products into performance tiers—High, Mid, and Low Performers—and calculates KPIs like recency, average order revenue, and monthly sales trends.

Customer Report – Captures customer behaviors by segmenting users into VIP, Regular, and New categories. It aggregates key indicators such as total orders, spending, product diversity, and engagement over time. KPIs like customer recency, average order value, and monthly spending patterns help in profiling and retention strategies.
